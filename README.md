# Digit Recognizer

A web-based application for recognizing handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

Users can draw digits on an interactive canvas, and the application predicts the digit in real time using a trained deep learning model.  
The CNN is developed using TensorFlow/Keras and served through a Flask backend, while the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

- Python and Flask  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Bootstrap

## Features

- Canvas Drawing – Intuitive interface for sketching digits  
- Digit Prediction – Real-time classification using a CNN model  
- Clear Button – Allows users to reset the canvas for new input
